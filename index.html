          <h2>
            Getting to design and create new software and website with real values
            was always something that I was drawn towards, and with both a programming
            and design background, I decided to take the steps to be a frontend developer.
            I am currently working towards my computer science degree right now, and have
            been a graphic designer for the last 2 years, working for my univeristy as well
            as for companies such as Redbull and Riot Games.
